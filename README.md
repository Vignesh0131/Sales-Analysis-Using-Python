# Sales-Analysis-Using-Python

## Project Overview

This project analyzes sales data to answer important business questions about sales performance, 
customer behavior, and product preferences. Using Python, `pandas` was employed for data processing, 
and `matplotlib` for visualizing the results, making insights more accessible and actionable.

## Questions Addressed

The analysis in this project answers the following questions:<br>

**1.What was the best month for sales, and how much revenue was earned?** <br>
**2.Which city had the highest number of sales?** <br>
**3.What is the best time for advertisement?** <br>
**4.Which product was sold the most?** <br>
**5.What products are frequently bought together?** <br>

## Tools and Libraries Used

1.**Python**: Main programming language.<br>
2.**pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.<br>
3.**matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.<br>

## Project Structure

The main sections of the project are:<br>

1.**Data Loading**: The sales data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.<br>
2.**Data Cleaning**: Missing values and irrelevant data are handled to ensure accurate analysis.<br>
3.**Data Analysis**: Key questions are answered through data aggregation, filtering, and manipulation.<br>
4.**Data Visualization**: Results are visualized using matplotlib to make insights easier to interpret.<br>

## Analysis Summary

Each question was answered as follows:<br>

1.**Best Month for Sales**: Determined the month with the highest revenue.<br>
2.**City with Highest Sales**: Identified the city with the most number of sales.<br>
3.**Best Time for Advertisement**: Analyzed the time of day with the highest sales to suggest optimal advertisement timing.<br>
4.**Most Sold Product**: Found the product with the highest sales volume.<br>
5.**Frequently Bought Together Products**: Identified combinations of products often bought together.<br>

## Visualizations

All questions are supplemented with visualizations, including:<br>

1.**Monthly Sales Revenue**: A bar chart showing the monthly revenue.<br>
2.**City Sales**: A line chart showing sales volume per city.<br>
3.**Sales by Hour**: A bar chart to identify the best times for advertisements.<br>
4.**Product Sales Volume**: A bar chart indicating the most popular products.<br>
5.**Frequently Bought Together**: A barchart showing product pairs frequently purchased together.<br>

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into sales data that can guide business decisions, 
such as optimal advertisement timing, high-demand locations, and popular products.
